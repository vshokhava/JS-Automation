Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it seems as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.
